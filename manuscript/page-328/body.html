Reading Homer is very much like such a circuit; the present object alone arresting our attention, we lose sight of what precedes, and do not concern ourselves about what is to follow."—"Dramatic Literature," p. 75.</p><p>"There cannot be a clearer indication than this description —so graphic in the original poem—of the true character of the Homeric agora.</p></div> </div>
